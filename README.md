Exploring Weather Trends 

Project Summary:
In this project, I analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.

Instructions:

Extract the data from the database. 
Open up the CSV in whatever tool you feel most comfortable using. 
Create a line chart that compares your city’s temperatures with the global temperatures. 
Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your city’s averages, as well as overall trends. 

Tools used:
SQL - to extract data from database
Excel - to analyze and plot visualization 



Observations:



Toronto’s temperature is cooler than global average temperature
Throughout the timeline temp differences remain pretty consistent
Global avg temp had a spike from 1773 to 1787, while Toronto’s temp didnt see that much of a fluctuations during that same periods
In 1818, toronto recorded it’s lowest temp of 5.9c
Temperature is rising steadily for both global and the city of Toronto 
From 1845 to 1893, Toronto’s temperature was pretty flat
